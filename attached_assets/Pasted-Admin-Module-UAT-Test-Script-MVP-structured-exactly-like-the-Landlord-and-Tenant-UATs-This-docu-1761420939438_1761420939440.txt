Admin Module UAT Test Script (MVP), structured exactly like the Landlord and Tenant UATs.

This document defines how your Admin Portal will be tested in Replit (or any other environment), ensuring it covers system oversight, user management, data integrity, and compliance monitoring — all critical for MVP and future FCA/ICO readiness.

🧩 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements for UAT)

Add role-based mock data (Admin / Landlord / Tenant) for test accounts.

Implement UAT dashboard checklist in Replit or Notion for testers to mark Pass/Fail.

Connect audit logs to a simple reporting endpoint (/api/admin/reports).

Conduct load testing with mock 500-user dataset.
