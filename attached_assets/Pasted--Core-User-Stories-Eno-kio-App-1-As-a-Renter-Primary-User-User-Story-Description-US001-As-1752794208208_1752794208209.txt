🚀 User Flow Summary (Narrative Format)
“As a UK renter, I sign up for Enoíkio using my email and set up my rent details. I connect my bank securely or input my past 3 payments manually. On my dashboard, I see that I’ve paid on time for 6 months straight. I generate a PDF report and share it with a potential landlord before moving. I also send a verification link to my current landlord to confirm it. I get a rent reminder before the 1st of every month. Eventually, I download my verified credit-building history to share with a mortgage lender.”
