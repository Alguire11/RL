Product intent gleaned from the docs

The UAT report describes “RentLedger” as a dual-sided platform: landlords manage properties, tenants, payments, analytics, and documents; tenants register, upload proof of rent, track verification-backed credit history, and download ledgers; and an admin surface handles moderation, subscriptions, and revenue analytics.

Repository reality

The source tree only contains a bare client folder (no backend, database schema, infrastructure, or even a package manifest), so nothing in the repo can actually build or run as delivered.

The only top-level React entry point (App.tsx) attempts to route to more than twenty landlord/tenant/admin pages, yet none of those modules exist in the tree, so the app would crash immediately at runtime due to unresolved imports.

Shared utilities referenced throughout the UI (e.g., @/lib/queryClient, @/lib/utils, @/hooks/useAuth, @/hooks/use-toast) are also missing entirely, which means even the available components cannot render without throwing module-resolution errors.

UI/UX observations

Navigation is designed for a complex, role-aware layout, but because the underlying authentication hook and admin queries are absent, the menu logic cannot determine user state and every link points to non-existent screens.

Even within the existing components there are polish gaps (e.g., NotificationBell imports useEffect but never uses it), hinting that the UI layer has not been fully reviewed or tested yet.

Backend/data gaps

The documentation promises Express APIs, PostgreSQL storage, session handling, payment verification endpoints, and reporting engines, yet there is no server code, database migrations, or configuration anywhere in the repo; the “backend” exists only in the prose of the UAT report.

Overall assessment & next steps

The repository does not implement the tenant/landlord/admin experience described in the docs; it is a partially scaffolded frontend without the pages, hooks, utilities, or backend required to make the product functional.

To reach the promised MVP, you would need to: add the missing React pages and shared hooks/utilities, supply a real backend (API server, auth, persistence, reporting), and then iterate on UI/UX details (navigation states, validation, typography consistency, flow screenshots) once the app actually runs.

Treat the existing documentation as a requirements reference rather than evidence of implementation; every feature listed there still needs to be built and verified in code.
